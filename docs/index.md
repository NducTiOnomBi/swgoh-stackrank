## Welcome to the SWGOH Stack Rank Tool Documentation

The purpose of this tool is to analyze your entire collection of characters, and rank them in order of priority for the purpose of modding within [Grandivory's Mods Optimizer for Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes™](https://mods-optimizer.swgoh.grandivory.com/). Characters are ranked based on several criteria such as their standing within "the meta", gearing, relics, abilities levels (e.g. zetas), character synergies that exist within the collection, and more.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/NducTiOnomBi/swgoh-stackrank/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/NducTiOnomBi/swgoh-stackrank/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
